# Deep-Learning-model-on-Audio-Processing
This project uses TensorFlow and signal processing techniques to detect Capuchinbird calls from audio recordings. The code loads and preprocesses WAV and MP3 files, converts them into spectrograms, and trains a deep learning model to classify the presence of Capuchinbird calls. It resamples audio to 16kHz mono, processes the data through a TensorFlow pipeline, and applies a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification. The trained model predicts on both single audio clips and longer recordings, with post-processing steps to group consecutive detections and count the number of bird calls in forest recordings.
